description: What it is, and how to combat it

As part of my preparation work prior to beginning at Hack Reactor, we were given an article to read about the phenomenon of [Impostor Syndrome][impostor]. In a nutshell, it is the idea that a person might believe themselves to be less capable and talented than they really are. It is characterized by a belief that one has gotten to a certain position through dumb luck rather than actuall skill and competence, and by a persistent fear that one will be found out as a fraud. In the tech world and in STEM careers at large, it is said that women and minorities are much more susceptible to Impostor Syndrome because of being vastly underrepresented in the field.

I can certainly relate to the feeling of faking my way through a field even while everyone around me told me I was doing well. When I first started my teaching career, I spent virtually my entire first year not fully believing that I was really a teacher, even though my colleagues assured me that I was doing fine and had nothing to worry about. I don't exactly remember when or how I stopped feeling this way, but eventually I realized that I actually saw and believed in myself as a teacher.

I fully expect to have some growing pains as I transition to a career in software development, but I believe that knowing about the phenomenon of impostor syndrome will help innoculate me to some of its effects. Already over the course of the first half of Hack Reactor, I have worked through feelings of being hopelessly lost and behind, only to emerge on the other side realizing that I have survived, learned a great deal, and not actually been as lost as I feared. On some level, the way that learning experiences at Hack Reactor have been structured have actually helped me get very comfortable with the feeling of not knowing exactly what to do, because I know from experience that I can figure out how to get myself unstuck.

In fact, as I write this, all of us in my cohort at Hack Reactor have just finished taking a 6-hour comprehensive assessment of all the topics we covered in the first half of the course. To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what to expect coming into it, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how straightforward the assessment felt. While there were definitely parts that challenged me, I never once felt like any of the material was beyond me. It is incredibly mind-blowing to think about how much I have been able to learn and apply successfully in just the first half of our program. If someone would have told me 6 weeks ago that by now, I would know this much and be able to do as much as I can, I would never have believed it. Between my ever-growing knowledge of current web-development technologies, and my burgeoning in myself as an actual programmer, I very much feel that I have some weapons to draw upon to combat the impostor syndrome as I continue down this new professional path.
